<h2>About</h2>
Hello, my name is Kwon Kyunghyun.

I was born in 1998 in Daegu Metropolitan City. I am currently studying Computer Engineering at Dankook University, with a particular interest in databases. I am also serving as the vice president of the Computer Engineering Department, actively participating in departmental activities.

I have a proactive personality and enjoy taking on new challenges. I thrive on growth through new experiences and always maintain a positive attitude, valuing living life joyfully. Thanks to this, I have gained diverse experiences and built strong connections with many people.

My future goal is to become a backend developer. To achieve this, I plan to participate in various competitions to hone my skills. Ultimately, I aspire to develop my own app and introduce it to the world. I am committed to continuous learning and effort to achieve these goals.

Thank you for listening to my story. I look forward to your continued interest and support.
